# iReporter
Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
* Have a text editor (vs-code, atom or sublime text) and
* Git-bash for windows
* Have a heroku account OR Postman

```
e.g
vs-code or sublime-text AND
Git Bash or CLI
```

### Installing

After cloning this repo, `cd` into it and on your command line run `npm install` to install the dependencies located in the `package.json` file.

```
e.g
User@guest MINGW64 ~
$ cd fast-food-fast
User@guest MINGW64 ~/iReporter
$ npm install
```

Use `npm start` to start the iReporter app
```
e.g
User@guest MINGW64 ~/iReporter
$ npm start
```
## _You can now test the API endpoints below via Postman_

## FOR TESTING PURPOSES
Create a new red-flag record
POST `host:port/api/v1/red-flags`

Fetch all red-flag records
GET `host:port/api/v1/red-flags`

Fetch a specific red-flag record
GET `host:port/api/v1/red-flags/<red-flag-id>`

Edit a specific red-flage record's location
PATCH `host:port/api/v1/red-flags/<red-flag-id>/location`

Edit a specific red-flag record's cmment
PATCH `host:port/api/v1/red-flags/<red-flag-id>/comment`

Delete a specific red-flag record
DELETE `host:port/api/v1/red-flags/<red-flag-id>`


_Using the application/json format_
```
e.g
POST host:port/api/v1/red-flags

{
	"createdBy": 2,
    "title": "Theft",
    "type": "red-flag",
    "location": "12.233, -3.1232313",
    "images": [
        "imageURL1",
        "imageURL2"
    ],
    "videos": [
        "videoURL1",
        "videoURL2"
    ],
    "comment": "This is a report on how they stole my car... Last week i was... to be continued"
}

```
Hit send on Postman and expect this:
```
{
    "status": 201,
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 4,
            "message": "Created red-flag record"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Running the tests
Use `npm test` to run test to see a tabulated test result coverage

```
e.g
User@guest MINGW64 ~/iReporter
$ npm test
```

### Break down into end to end tests
The test checks all the routes mention above for conformity. It also tests all the methods and classes used to control backend activities.

```
e.g
describe("Create red-flag record end-point", () => {

	it("should return 201 if all input fields are validated correctly", (done) => {
		request.post("/api/v1/red-flags")
			.send({
				"createdBy": 2,
				"title": "Stealing",
				"type": "red-flag",
				"location": "12.233334, 2.323123",
				"images": [
					"imageURL1",
					"imageURL2" ],
				"videos": [
					"videoURL1",
					"videoURL2" ],
				"comment": "This is a report on... to be continued"
			}).end((err, res) => {
				expect(res.status).to.eql(201);
				expect(res.body.data[0].message).to.eql("Created red-flag record");
				expect(res.body.data[0].message).to.be.a("string");
				expect(res.body.status).to.be.a("number");
				should.not.exist(err);
				should.exist(res.body);
				(res.body).should.be.an("object");
				if (err) { return done(err); }
				done();
			});
	});
});
```
The example able is a test to validate the user form input fields.
It expects a status code of 201 if the user accesses the route `host:port/api/v1/red-flags` and checks if it truly returns a 201 status.
